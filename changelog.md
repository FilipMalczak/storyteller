# v0.1.0

- [x] add license
- [x] add some meaningful readme
- [x] make the repo public (long way until there)
- [x] add better session management (extract PersistentRoot with start/end session; requires renaming to tree)
    - [x] update tests to use it
- [x] rename StackedExecutor to PersistentTaskTree
    - [x] tests and some impl details still use executor as variable names (not done; in a way it makes sense, since tree has execute() methods)
- [x] add journal listener (may be easier if sessions are well handled already)
- [x] change choice to parallel task (will be way easier after renaming to tree, because methods will be easier to name)
    - [x] keep choice as a utility method? (nope, see below)
    - [x] THIS REQUIRES MUCH MORE TESTING (this didnt actually happen; choice isnt part of task tree API anymore)
    - [x] PARALLEL NODES IN GENERAL NEEDS TESTING
- [x] test journaling (will be easier once session management is done, as we won't have to spin up subprocess just to do amendments, etc)
    - [x] actually implement SHRUNK entry
    - [x] start, define, run, end
    - [x] start, define, run, catch, interrupt
    - [x] extend, amend - sequential
    - [x] narrow, amend - sequential
    - [x] change, amend - sequential
    - [x] extend, amend - parallel
    - [x] narrow, amend - parallel
    - [x] extend, narrow, amend - parallel
    - [x] inflate, augment
    - [x] deflate, augment
    - [x] refilter, augment
    - [x] extend, amend, inflate, augment

- [x] deletion
    - [x] deleting files
        - [x] implementation
        - [x] testing
    - [x] when merging DBs (in parallel nodes) - deleting documents/objects
        - [x] implementation
        - [x] testing
- [x] parallel node needs to track what has been incorporated; if that has changed between runs, we need to amend the node
    - give choice whether incorporation order matters
    - if it does, add some new journal entry ("reordered"?)
- [x] add JitPack info to README
